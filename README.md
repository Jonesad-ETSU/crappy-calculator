# Welcome to my Crappy Calculator

This calculator was quickly thrown together in order to prove to myself that I could make a <em>very</em> basic React application by myself without any help. This calculator is very insecure (it uses [eval](https://24ways.org/2005/dont-be-eval/) to calculate the answer, and it is very impractical. However, if for some ungodly reason you would like to try it out, see [Installation](#installation). Also, an image is located at the bottom of the page in [Gallery](#gallery).

## Installation
To install, simply clone the repo: <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/jonesad-etsu/crappy-calculator.git`

Then navigate to the project in your preffered terminal and use the following command: <br/>
`npm install`

After installing the dependencies, you should be good to go and run the program by entering the following into the terminal: <br/>
`npm start`
